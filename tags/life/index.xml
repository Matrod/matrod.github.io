      <description>I´ve just received what it seems to be her last message to me. It´s been a roller coaster, as usual. I cried a lot, I felt alone, I was in pain. The first and strongest impulse was to write and write and write some more. Her mail was short and somehow cold. It is perfectly understandable in our situation. She wanted to come back, to try things out again. She realized all the things we had together, in her own words.</description>

      <description>It’s kind of weird to feel I’m in the eye of the storm. She sleeps peacefully with our cat on her side and I feel free and content just for a brief period of time, feeling that all our problems, fights, disagreements, tears, sadness and crazy feelings just don’t exist. It’s like observing them from a far distance, watching them in a blurry fashion. Perhaps life is about these moments and nothing else.</description>

      <description>It happens from time to time. Everything seems to be going smoothly and then, a dark and long shadow appears out of nowhere (well, it comes from the same place almost all the times), to haunt me yet again. I used to think that as long as I did well and the years just passed, accumulating experience, the shadow was less likely to return. I was wrong again. Perhaps the only thing left to do is to just accept its existence and deal with it.</description>

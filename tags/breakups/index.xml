      <description>I´ve just received what it seems to be her last message to me. It´s been a roller coaster, as usual. I cried a lot, I felt alone, I was in pain. The first and strongest impulse was to write and write and write some more. Her mail was short and somehow cold. It is perfectly understandable in our situation. She wanted to come back, to try things out again. She realized all the things we had together, in her own words.</description>

      <description>After a long time, finally I feel (somehow) free. No limits, no boundaries, just pure enjoyment and fun, sprinkled with small periods of apathy and tiredness. Nonetheless, the feeling of being able to do whatever I want with my time is an awesome experience.
It’s been a while since I spent one entire day sleeping, watching movies, nibbling food and just being present. Somehow I’m starting to understand my true nature.</description>

      <description>It’s kind of weird to feel I’m in the eye of the storm. She sleeps peacefully with our cat on her side and I feel free and content just for a brief period of time, feeling that all our problems, fights, disagreements, tears, sadness and crazy feelings just don’t exist. It’s like observing them from a far distance, watching them in a blurry fashion. Perhaps life is about these moments and nothing else.</description>

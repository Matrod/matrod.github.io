      <description>I´ve just received what it seems to be her last message to me. It´s been a roller coaster, as usual. I cried a lot, I felt alone, I was in pain.

She wanted to come back, to try things out again. She realized all the things we had together, in her own words.</description>

      <description>Life is strange. The most important things happen in the wrong moments, it seems. One chapter ends, another begins but it feels like nothing it’s in place. There’s something always missing. Something not finished or not completely done. Why wait? I keep telling myself? Why not? Something inside me says “Let go, totally and freely. Don’t be afraid”, nonetheless when I feel so happy and comfortable with a supposedly “wrong situation” the question lingers again: “What should I do then?</description>

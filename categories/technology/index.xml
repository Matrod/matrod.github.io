      <description>Many months since my last post. A lot has happened, but I hadn´t the time to put it all here. In other news, I´ve changed my hosting provider. After some problems transferring the domain name and pointing the DNS servers properly, I´m finally back online. It´s kind of annoying to see that I couldn´t migrate the old posts easily, because the database structure seems to be a little bit different from the version that I was using some months ago.</description>

      <title>Powerbook Friendly</title>

      <description>I´m the proud owner of an Apple iBook notebook. I´m quite happy with it, but at the same time I´m tempted to change it for one of the new breed of Powerbooks, since they have reduced their price in a very interesting way. This can sound a little dumb, but I need more power for my applications (Reason, Photoshop, etc.) and I don´t want to spend US$ 2500 in a G5 dual processor computer (It could be really nice, but money is always an issue).</description>

      <description>I used to believe that this weblogging software was difficult to manage, but happily, I was wrong. I´m starting to understand how this thing works. It is not difficult at all. My first modification attempts were some kind of succesful. I think that I must learn some PHP (only the basics) to get better results. The best thing? I can post my articles with ease. Customization is a nice thing, but it is not the most important for the moment.</description>

      <description>I´ve just read that there´s an “interesting” paradox regarding big companies: every year they report almost always about having record earnings, but you keep hearing that there are and will be massive layoffs. How can this be possible? Yes, I know, this is the way of the capitalist economy we live in, but this means that more people will lose their jobs, and more important, those proud owners will get even richer… And yes, there are people still dying in 3rd.</description>

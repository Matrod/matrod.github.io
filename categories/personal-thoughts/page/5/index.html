      <div class="content">
        In this country, the best entertainment is to watch football matches (or, in the region where I live, going to the mountains… how boring). Today, the local team has the chance to win a trophy for the first time. They’re going to lose, of course, because the team that they will play against is better and stronger. But this is no handicap for the people to find a reason to get drunk, shout, party and so on.

      <div class="content">
        This is one of that kind of horrible days when everything seems to be normal, but it´s not. Normally, this happens after a good one or two days of success and strong motivation, strange. It’s that difficult to stay focused and concentrated? I simply can´t. It’s like having a sixth sense warning you all the time, like if you can´t see the light at the end of the tunnel, never. The only relief is to know that some calm and relaxed days are on their way, aren´t they?

      <div class="content">
        Is it true that you are “that” smart? Is it really possible to reach every and each one of your wishes and dreams? (by the way, Are they really yours?), are you obliged to get all the goals that your parents and friends and relatives are putting on you? What happens if you simply want to stop and think about your life? This remembers me of the beginning of the Trainspotting movie: What if you don’t want to live that way?

      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">May 2, 2005</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
        Many times I have questioned myself about if I´m doing it right. I often compare my life with others that I consider “better”. How stupid. Doing this only produces two things: emptiness and frustration. I feel that I have let pass many special and unique moments only for trying to comply with everyone´s wishes. I think I should listen to myself with attention, to discover the things that I love and hate, to start learning how to live with them.

      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">April 27, 2005</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
        Today is one of those horrible days in which I feel completely alone, useless and bored. That dark and dense feeling of emptiness, the incapacity of fitting in. So, I stumbled upon this. It´s weird and produces a strange sensation to find people that stores so many secrets, and see that they´re brave enough to share them, anonymously, though. It´s a kind of relief to see that I´m not the only one not willing to share those dark things that lurk in my mind.

        I´ve been following (with more or less interest), all the things that have surrounded the Pope´s death. It was really curious to see many world politic and religious leaders meeting at St. Peter Square, shaking hands and sharing a little chat like they were old friends. As usual, this is only diplomatic stuff, nobody really cares about their neighbours, and everything will remain the same after a couple of days: war, religious differences and so on.

      <div class="content">
        Human beings don´t stop to amaze me (but not in the best way, I must admit), specially when I realize that many of us simply don´t show any trace of respect or “fair behavior” with each other… I deeply hate the people that, for example, park their cars using two or more (!) parking places. Parking is getting more and more difficult here in Europe these days, (I´m starting to believe that buying a car is the people´s ultimate goal in their lives, or something), and those morons only think in themselves.

        Look at you for a moment. What do you see? I think I know the answer: you probably punish yourself too hard. “I see worries, that I’m ugly/fat/tall/short, problems, not enough money”;. Have you stopped only once to think that you are surrounded by people with lots of trouble, sickness, that do drugs, smoke, trapped in alcoholism, workoholic, with very dark and dramatic stories behind, and they do continue to run their lives in the way they can?

        Yes, thanks to a dear friend, I finally made it to the net. It´s been a hard way, since my knowledge in these matters is really limited, but I wanted to open my mind to the world, to say many things that I think that should be out there, and not only for myself. Let´s see what happens. Please enjoy…

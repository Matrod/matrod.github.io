        This can sound quite funny, to say the least, but 4 weeks have passed since the accident, and I´m still struggling to start many “queued” things on my head. Now I´m not annoyed anymore: I´m officially worried. I´ve been listening to some specialized “entrainment” sessions to try and reduce my depression, and, despite some minor improvements, I feel more or less the same: without energy and motivation to move on. It´s kind of scary not to know where are you headed, and to continue doing the same things like a robot, because there is nothing better out there.

        Some days ago I fell from a Mountain Board and broke my left knee. It was painful, but now I finally have some time off (if I decide to shut down my Office VPN connection, of course).
By the way, today I decided to shave my head. It was something I wanted to do a long time ago, and the chance just appeared. No prying eyes, no roles to play, perfect!

        Yet another week. More complaining, more tiredness, more and more of the same things. Sometimes, life is like an old movie, moving slowly and without sound to nowhere. I´ve recently discovered that many of my life certainties are not there anymore. I try to start over, to correct my past mistakes, but I simply can´t find the required energy to do so. Perhaps it´s time to seek some help. The bad part is that when I did this in the past, I ended feeling worse, and all my problems remained more or less the same.

        What does it feel like to know that almost everything you believe in, or the things you like, are a fake? Every day, I realize that the world that I used to believe I live in, it´s not there anymore. Friends are inexistent, people that you think is there, isn´t. The feeling of belonging to anything vanishes slowly, leaving a big void of loneliness and sadness. No lasting relationships with friends or loved ones.

      <div class="content">
        The problem is that it´s not reachable by any means. You try to realize a strategy, but it’s useless. Usually, you’re late. Very late. Some thug has already picked up what you think is yours, and there’s nothing left to be done. Only shame and retreat. It’s becoming so familiar that´s kind of scary. I think I must change my way of judging the world in order to fit in. It’s difficult, but it has to be done, otherwise, I’ll be left behind, alone…

      <div class="content">
        I adore weekends, but not for the same reasons regular people say they’re good (partying, drinking and so on). I like them mostly for the possibility of having time only for me, without constraints nor rules. It’s almost 2 AM on saturday and I’m wide awake, thrashing around with my laptop, without worrying about getting up late the next day. I simply cannot cope with someone else telling me what to do, at what time should I arrive and so on.

        I hate ads. Their simple vision about reaching happiness by using some sort of “snake oil” product or buying a brand new fuc.ing car, makes me sick. Everytime I think about all the people that even doesn’t have a TV set to watch them, I almost cry. How will an unemployed person feel about not having the money or the power or the looks to be accepted? I remember this Simpsons episode (Mr.

        It´s a bit funny, but the simplest thing that has happened in my life is the one that have been leading me through the road of insight and self-knowledge. Some people have helped, of course (thanks L, for those marvelous book suggestions), but the “core” of everything is simply wanting to know more and be more aware of the present. A fascinating trip so far…

        This might sound a little funny, but, while other people enjoy inmensely doing future plans, this thing scares the hell out of me. Just to think in all the changes, worries, loneliless, possible lack of money, a hostile environment (no, I´m not leaving the planet, for now…), is terrifying. The worst thing is that I need to move on, to change my life (once again) and keep searching for that lost light that left me long ago.

        Yes, I have to admit it: traveling makes me nervous. Specially when going to an unknown place. Having a GPS has helped a little, but the main discovery is that people annoys me a lot. Consequences? A bad stomach, pain in the back, and most important, not being able to taste local food marvels… I need to find a solution for this fast!

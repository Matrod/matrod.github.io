      <div class="content">
        It´s really complicated to look into her eyes and not feel sadness. I know that we have to do it, but it´s so damn difficult. Being with her all these years has been a crazy ride: sometimes very good, others really bad. But at the end of the day, the bond between us is pretty strong, made with laughs, tears, sex and patience. Letting her go is the right thing to do, but I cannot help thinking in those good moments, the peace between us, her happiness and love for me, our travels (many of them without moving) and those “bed and book” afternoons.

      <div class="content">
        I deeply hate her. But she doesn´t know. She´s there, happily living her life without knowing it. I haven´t told her about those things on my head, but I´m certain that she knows. I´m starting to think that I scare her, and that´s the reason for not acknowledging what´s going on. The worst thing is that she´s living with another person, and therefore, there´s no chance for anything. I don´t like not to have things under control, but this has a lot to do with my legendary shyness and stupidity.

        Finally it happened. I´m leaving. It sounds kind of weird, since when I knew it, after the first feelings of relief, I got scared. Now what? I asked myself. But, strangely, I have started to stop thinking about what´s next. I only want to stop. To breathe. To stop worrying about everything. I won´t miss the things I´m going to left behind: no friends, no valuable relationships, no good moments. Nothing.

      <div class="content">
        Today I received some news about my ex-wife. She´s pregnant. It´s kind of strange, since I haven´t talked with her for many months, and the last time this occurred, she told me that she didn´t want to speak with me anymore. We used to be friends after breaking up, but then things went wrong. My feelings are a mixture at this time. I hope she´s ok, and her partner (if any) is a good person.

      <div class="content">
        This title can be a little weird, but it describes perfectly my current situation. I feel trapped, but not by the circumstances, but by myself. I feel that I lack the will or determination to break free. I have now more clear ideas about where I want to go, or what I want to do, but future is still looking blurry. I´ve been offered another project at my company, but the fact is that I don´t want to be here anymore.

      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">April 18, 2007</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
        Some time ago, a close friend told me that whenever he arrived at the town where he lives, he felt that his energy levels drained fast. Something similar happens to me at my office. It´s like a black hole. No matter how energetic I wake up in the morning: in the moment that I sit down in my desk, all vanishes… Perhaps it´s time to seek new challenges somewhere else. It´s really bad not to have energy to pursue my own interests, and not only the company ones.

      <div class="content">
        Some days have passed since I received the news about my fathers´ death. Perhaps this is not the best moment to write, but somehow it soothes me and helps to relieve the pain. It´s kind of strange, but this has made me think about life and death, my role in this world, my attitudes towards the rest of the people surrounding me, my mistakes, my goals, my dreams, the futility of many stupid things that, we believe, are important, the fragility of life, the moments that are running fast past behind.

      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">November 1, 2006</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
        The main problem of having a lot of spare time is that you tend to think too much about the same things. Decisions that you´ve already made, choices or plans already underway. Everything goes under a cruel scrutiny, trying to find that glitch or error (inexistent, most of the time) that causes disconfort, fear or depression. It´s kind of hard to trust ourselves, to close our eyes and walk believing in our choices.

        Andy Warhol said that every one of us has the right to enjoy 15 minutes of fame. I think my time has come and I don´t want to pass. You only live once (not twice, like Mr. Bond used to say), and I stopped thinking about stupid things at last! I´m motivated, happy and confident…
Enjoy: A simple word but quite complicated to apply. Ready or not, here I come…

        Kind of weird to post this, but I´m considering to do it once more. Something says that this time is gonna be ok, but it still is a strange sensation. Perhaps I found the right partner. In 23 days I´ll find out. In the meantime, I´m really excited, and for the first time in ages, happy…

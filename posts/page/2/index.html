        Just saw the movie and I must say I´m sad, angry, and most of all, disappointed. That story reminded me of my own current situation, and I didn´t like what I saw. What is the point of living in a deeply sick society, as Krishnamurti said, when nobody cares for you or your problems, where nothing you do seems to be useful or purposeful? What´s the point of having dreams, if all the system is designed to crush them all?

        The moment of the week I like the most is sunday morning, when the sun has barely appeared on the horizon. I go out to our balcony and stare at the empty streets, wondering about why most days and life moments are not like this. No noise, no human beings on sight, no annoyances or distractions, only a deep and soothing silence mixed with the elegant movements of the trees in front of our house.

        It´s been a long while since my last post. Paradoxically, I´ve been writing a lot for my job and other projects, but not here. Today is the day. Lately, a weird feeling is living with me almost permanently. The main effect is a generalized lack of air when I try to breathe. My chest aches and my head spins like crazy. When it happens, I try to study my surroundings, to determine what´s going on or what can be causing this, but the only conclusion that I´ve reached so far is that in the most cases, is triggered by anxiety or the though about having to do something I don´t really want to.

        It´s quite funny when those old viruses or daemons come lurking again to my mind. It can in the form of a mail message, a face, a voice or some special situation that points to me and triggers memories, sensations and more or less frequently, rage or sadness. I used to say that when you don´t see someone for quite a long time, you still think about this person as if time hasn´t passed.

        Sometimes is difficult to tame those daemons that have something to do with our more primal instincts: sex, rage or survival. These days I´ve been recalling a book I read many years ago, where the author described a society based on a closed-circuit life, this is, birth, life and dead inside a huge building, without ever going outdoors. People there were heavily divided by their abilities. The most successful ones lived higher, the others, lower.

        It´s a strange feeling. In my last trips to my home land, when I return, I feel something like sadness, but it´s not quite that. Instead, is a mixture between past and future, friends and company, and loneliness and isolation. Perhaps it´s time to go back, perhaps not. It seems that time is passing quickly and I´m beginning to understand many things about my life. Now we have a dog. What is to come, is yet to be seen…

        Don´t want to copy a bad movie title, specially being from him (her?). Lately, I´ve been realizing that some thoughts from long ago are true: my mom hates almost everyone. After my father´s death, she´s been immersed in a strange process of change, but not for good, I shall say, instead, her life is going into irrational hate and fear. I can´t even imagine what it is like to be in her position, her husband suddenly dead in a very painful way, but, instead of turning inside and closing the doors to the external world, the “lesson” should have been to be more kind, since life is too short to spend it fighting, feeling envy, hatred or remorse.

        I haven´t written much in some time. A lot has happened. About a year has passed since I decided to take a sabbatical to gather myself again. In the meanwhile, I got married. She was the one, all the time, but I didn´t realize it until it was almost too late. I even crossed the ocean several times to beg for another chance.
I fought with my old daemons in a way I did not think I was able to.

        Today I saw his book in a store, and I felt miserable. Most of my life I´ve been ranting and complaining about almost all, but I haven´t accomplished none. To add insult to injury, I´ve realized that my “knowledge” about many topics is outdated or it doesn´t interest anyone now. I keep falling behind. But now I feel rage and sadness. No force of will to go on. In the other hand, I´m still waiting for that opportunity to come, patiently as instructed by many.

        Suddenly, I feel an urge to write down my thoughts, the things that happen in my life and the ideas that have been lurking into my mind for ages. It´s really nice to be into something, without pressure. To do it just for fun, as a way to put out many crazy ideas that cross my brain. Refreshing feeling. My plans are to continue, but who knows? The daemons can come back at any moment, sucking all my energy yet again…

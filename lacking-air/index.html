    <div class="content">
      <p>It´s been a long while since my last post. Paradoxically, I´ve been writing a lot for my job and other projects, but not here. Today is the day. Lately, a weird feeling is living with me almost permanently. The main effect is a generalized lack of air when I try to breathe. My chest aches and my head spins like crazy. When it happens, I try to study my surroundings, to determine what´s going on or what can be causing this, but the only conclusion that I´ve reached so far is that in the most cases, is triggered by anxiety or the though about having to do something I don´t really want to.</p>
<p>Somehow, I still feel that I´m falling behind. Old ideas that seemed fabulous when created, now look ridiculously old and stupid. The idea of being walking to nowhere is lurking behind me again. What´s the reason for everything? What I´m missing? What´s the point of living?</p>
<p>No answers yet, despite fighting with all means available to shed some light over the subject. Sad things happened. My master abandoned me, and I feel a little bit betrayed. New sensation, since I don´t trust almost nobody. Now I remember why…</p>
<p>“¿Shall we continue?” I ask myself every single day. Right now I have a loved one beside me, and doing something radical could pose as a major betrayal. “Don´t do others things you don´t like to be done to yourself”, but what about me? My questions? My uneasiness? My despair?</p>
<p>Nobody seems to notice. You have to pretend everything is allright most of the time to support others. But energy eventually runs out. Worse yet, right now I cannot be sick, sad or tired. My “miracle” teachings have robbed that possibility. I need to be perfect all the time, since I´m selling these ideas to others, to try and change my life direction. Happiness and pain at the same time, more pain than anything else, after all…</p>
<p>I look around and I see many objects: mementos of past times and feelings. But, no relief comes from them. They´re there, silent and without motion, no transfer of ideas.</p>
<p>Precious moments of loneliness. They don´t last but appear from time to time. I deeply enjoy them. No commitments, no people, no noise.</p>
<p>What will be next? I don´t know and I´m starting to think that I don´t care, after all.</p>
